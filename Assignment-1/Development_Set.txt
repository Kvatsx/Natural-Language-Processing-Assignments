Dr. Karageorghis said "Push It" by Salt-N-Pepa and "Drop It Like It's
Hot" by Snoop Dogg are around that range, as is the dance remix of
"Umbrella" by Rihanna (so maybe the pop star was onto something). For
a high-intensity workout like a hard run, he suggested Glenn Frey's
"The Heat Is On."


Ms. Goldberg also includes on her playlist "Don't Phunk With My Heart"
by the Black Eyed Peas (130 B.P.M.), "Mr. Brightside" by the Killers
(150 B.P.M.), and "Dancing Queen" by Abba. The musical style that
seems to most reliably contain a high B.P.M. is dance music, said
Richard Petty, the founder of Power Music, a company that has produced
workout compilations for instructors and fitness enthusiasts for two
decades. "A rock song doesn't have that same consistency," said
Mr. Petty, a former D.J. who takes a metronomic approach to making
exercise music: He chooses a hit song with a catchy melody - say,
"Gold Digger" by Kanye West - and produces a remix whose B.P.M. count
is tailored to experience level and type of workout.

I recently got a file describing a library of rendering routines 
called SIPP (SImple Polygon Processor). Then Could anyone tell me where I can 
FTP the source code and which is the newest version around? Also, 'I've never used Renderman so I was wondering if Renderman 
is like SIPP'?  ie. a library of rendering routines which one uses to make 
a program that creates the image...
